# Implementation-Only Change

This change does not introduce new capabilities or modify existing requirements. It is a pure UI restructuring for improved usability.

**Reason:** The evidence form layout change maintains all existing functionality while improving the visual organization. No behavioral changes are being made to the system.

**Nature of Change:** Presentation layer reorganization
- Form fields remain the same
- Validation logic unchanged
- Event handlers unchanged
- Data model unchanged

All requirements for the evidence form remain as specified in the existing system specifications.
